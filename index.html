      <p>Hello! </p>

<p>I'm Darshana Sivakumar. Welcome to my website!</p>

<p>I am passionate about technology, design, entrepreneurship and social innovation. I love building amazing products.</p>

<p>I am currently pursuing the Master of Science in Software Management program at Carnegie Mellon Silicon Valley - a program that encompasses product innovation, entrepreneurship, and management. It is offered by the Integrated Innovation Institute, supported by the College of Engineering, Tepper School of Business, and the Carnegie Mellon School of Design within the College of Fine Arts.</p>

<p>I am interested in software development, product management, product design and user experience. I have done coursework in Human-Centered Design and Human-Computer Interaction.</p>

<p>I have work experience at Goldman Sachs (Technology Analyst) and Groupon (Associate Product Manager Intern). I am currently a product management practicum intern for IBM (Cloud Ecosystem Development) and a Teaching Assistant for two courses at CMU.</p>

<p>Over the past year I worked on an interesting project called REQUEST. You can see it here: <a href="http://www.request.to/">http://www.request.to/</a></p>
